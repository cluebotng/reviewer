'''Fernando Carlo''' (also known as '''Cope2''') is a [[graffiti]] artist from the [[South Bronx]], [[New York]]. He has been writing graffiti since 1978-79, and has gained international credit{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} for his work. Though he is now known worldwide, he didn't receive recognition in the mainstream graffiti world until the mid 1990's.

Cope2's cousin &quot;Chico 80&quot; influenced Cope into writing. In 1982 he made his own crew called Kids Destroy and eventually it changed to Kings Destroy after he dubbed himself &quot;King of the 4 Line&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cope2kingsdestroy.com/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Cope2 is well-known for his &quot;throw-up&quot; and is also one of the most known users of &quot;wildstyle&quot; graffiti, a style which originated in the Bronx.

Before the release of the game, ''[[Marc Ecko's Getting Up|Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure]]'', Cope2 called a local Councilman, [[Peter Vallone|Peter Vallone Jr.]], to complain about the shutting down of a 2005 publicity event for the title. The event, coordinated by Mark Ecko, called for the spray painting of vintage [[Railroad car|train cars]] during a [[block party]] celebrating Graffiti and Hip Hop culture. Vallone is noted as saying he was responsible for having the permit pulled for the event. The event permit was later reissued as Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the [[United States district court|Federal District Court]] in Manhattan over turned the previous ruling on grounds of [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Citing 1st Amendment, Judge Says City Must Allow Graffiti Party |publisher=The New York Times |date= 2005-08-23

Cope2 has been one of the main targets of the New York City Vandal Squad due to his high profile status in the graffiti world  and has been arrested for vandalism, theft and drug charges. He has served a total of 4 years in prison.
