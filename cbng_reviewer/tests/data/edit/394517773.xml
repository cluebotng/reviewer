''' Methamphetamine''' ({{pron-en|ˌmɛθæmˈfɛtəmiːn}} &lt;small&gt;[http://cougar.eb.com/soundc11/m/metham01.wav listen]&lt;/small&gt;), also known as '''metamfetamine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), '''dextromethamphetamine''', '''methylamphetamine''', '''N-methylamphetamine''', '''desoxyephedrine''', and colloquially as '''meth''' (not to be confused with [[methadone]], sometimes referred to as &quot;meth&quot; by [[opioid dependence|opioid users]], or with [[mephedrone]], sometimes referred to as &quot;meph&quot;), is a [[psychoactive]] [[stimulant]] ([[psychostimulant]] or [[psychoanaleptic]]) of the [[phenethylamine]] and [[amphetamine]] [[chemical classification|class]] of [[drugs]]. It increases [[alertness]], concentration, energy, and in high doses, can induce [[euphoria]], enhance [[self-esteem]], and increase [[libido]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn1-59385-174-X&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Mack, Avram H.; Frances, Richard J.; Miller, Sheldon I. |title=Clinical Textbook of Addictive Disorders, Third Edition |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= 207|isbn=1-59385-174-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Logan&quot;&gt;B.K.

==History==
[[Image:Blue Crystal Meth .jpg|left|thumb|[[Crystal]] methamphetamine was first [[Wiktionary:synthesize|synthesized]] in 1919 by [[Akira Ogata]].]]
Methamphetamine was first synthesized from [[ephedrine]] in Japan in 1893 by chemist [[Nagai Nagayoshi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110003609935/|author =Nagai N.|title = Kanyaku maou seibun kenkyuu seiseki (zoku)|journal= Yakugaku Zasshi |year=1893|volume= 127|pages= 832–860}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, crystallized methamphetamine was synthesized by [[Akira Ogata]] via [[redox|reduction]] of [[ephedrine]] using red [[phosphorus]] and [[iodine]]. In 1943, [[Abbott Laboratories]] requested for its approval from the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for the treatment of [[narcolepsy]], mild [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[postencephalitic parkinsonism]], chronic [[alcoholism]], cerebral [[arteriosclerosis]], and [[Allergic rhinitis|hay fever]]. Methamphetamine was approved for all of these indications in December, 1944.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} All of these indication approvals were eventually removed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The only two approved marketing indications remaining for methamphetamine are for [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and the short-term management of [[exogenous obesity]], although the drug is clinically established as effective in the treatment of [[narcolepsy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitler MM, Hajdukovic R, Erman MK 1993 306–17&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mitler MM, Hajdukovic R, Erman MK |title=Treatment of narcolepsy with methamphetamine |journal=Sleep |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=306–17 |year=1993 |month=June |pmid=8341891 |pmc=2267865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
One of the earliest uses of methamphetamine was during World War II, when it was used by Axis and Allied forces&lt;!-- Axis use of meth per se emphasized in source --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Grinspoon | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = Hedblom | title = Speed Culture: Amphetamine Use and Abuse in America | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = 1975-01-01 | location = | pages = 18 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=LyStWcRD6QIC&amp;lpg=PT1&amp;pg=PA18 | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0674831926 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The German military dispensed it under the trade name '''Pervitin'''. It was widely distributed across rank and division, from elite forces to tank crews and aircraft personnel, with many millions of tablets being distributed throughout the war.&lt;ref name=Pervitin&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,354606,00.html |title=The Nazi Death Machine: Hitler's Drugged Soldiers - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News - International |accessdate=2009-11-17 |last=Andreas Ulrich |first=Andreas |work=Spiegel Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1942 until his death in 1945, [[Adolf Hitler]] may have been given intravenous injections of methamphetamine by his personal physician [[Theodor Morell]]. It is possible that it was used to treat Hitler's speculated [[Parkinson's disease]], or that his Parkinson-like symptoms that developed from 1940 onwards resulted from using methamphetamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Doyle | first = D | year= 2005 | title= Hitler's Medical Care | url= http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/journal/issue/journal_35_1/Hitler%27s_medical_care.pdf | journal = Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh | volume=35 | pages=75–82 | format = PDF | accessdate=2006-12-28 | pmid= 15825245 | issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, methamphetamine was sold under the registered trademark of {{Nihongo|Philopon|ヒロポン|hiropon}} by [[Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma]] for civilian and military use. Similar to the situation in the rest of the world, the side effects of methamphetamine were not well studied, and regulation was not seen as necessary.

===Post-war use===
After World War II, a large Japanese military stockpile of methamphetamine, known by its trademark Philopon, flooded the market.&lt;ref name=Philopon&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://web.archive.org/web/20071221115601/http://www.yama-arashi.com/medical/antidepressants.htm | title = 抗うつ薬いろいろ (Various Antidepressants) | accessdate = 2006-07-14 | author = Digital Creators Studio Yama-Arashi | date=  2006-04-16 | work = 医療情報提供サービス | language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese Ministry of Health banned it in 1951; since then, it has been increasingly produced by the [[Yakuza]] criminal organization.&lt;ref name=banning_in_1951&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1989-01-01_1_page007.html | title = Japan: stimulant epidemics past and present | accessdate = 14 July 2006 | author = M. Tamura | date=  1989-01-01 | work = Bulletin on Narcotics | publisher = United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | pages = 83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the streets, it is also known as S, [[Shabu]], and Speed, in addition to its old trademarked name.

In the 1950s, there was a rise in the legal prescription of methamphetamine to the American public. In the 1954 edition of ''Pharmacology and Therapeutics'', indications for methamphetamine included &quot;[[narcolepsy]], [[Encephalitis|postencephalitic]] [[parkinsonism]], [[alcoholism]], certain [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] states, and in the treatment of [[obesity]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Grollman | first = Arthur | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Pharmacology and Therapeutics: a Textbook for Students and Practitioners of Medicine | publisher = Lea &amp; Febiger | year = 1954 | location = | pages = 209 | isbn = 0812101057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s saw the start of significant use of clandestinely manufactured methamphetamine as well as methamphetamine created in users' own homes for personal use. The recreational use of methamphetamine continues to this day.

===Legal restrictions===
{{See also|#Legality|l1=Legality}}
In 1983, laws were passed in the United States prohibiting possession of precursors and equipment for methamphetamine production. This was followed a month later by a bill passed in Canada enacting similar laws. In 1986, the U.S. government passed the Federal Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act in an attempt to curb the growing use of [[designer drug]]s. Despite this, use of methamphetamine expanded throughout rural United States, especially through the Midwest and South.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/209730.pdf Methamphetamine Use: Lessons Learned | National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1989, five U.S. federal laws and dozens of state laws have been imposed in an attempt to curb the production of methamphetamine. Methamphetamine can be produced in home laboratories using pseudoephedrine or ephedrine, which, at the time, were the active ingredients in over-the-counter drugs such as [[Sudafed]] and [[Contac]]. Preventive legal strategies of the past 17 years have steadily increased restrictions to the distribution of pseudoephedrine/ephedrine-containing products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunningham JK 2003&quot;&gt;Cunningham JK, Liu LM. (2003) Impacts of Federal ephedrine and pseudoephedrine regulations on methamphetamine-related hospital admissions. Addiction, 98, 1229–1237.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the U.S. [[Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005]], a subsection of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], there are restrictions on the amount of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine one may purchase in a specified time period and further requirements that these products must be stored in order to prevent theft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunningham JK 2003&quot;/&gt; Increasingly strict restrictions have resulted in the reformulation of many over-the-counter drugs, and some, such as [[Actifed]], have been discontinued entirely in the United States.

==Pharmacology==
A member of the family of [[phenethylamine]]s, methamphetamine is [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]], with two [[isomer]]s, [[levorotary]] and [[dextrorotatory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schep&quot;/&gt; The levorotary form, called [[levomethamphetamine]], is an [[over-the-counter drug]] used in [[inhaler]]s for nasal decongestion. Levomethamphetamine does not possess any significant [[central nervous system]] activity or [[Substance use disorder|addictive]] properties. This article deals only with the dextrorotatory form, called [[dextromethamphetamine (medical)|dextromethamphetamine]], and the [[racemic]] form.

Methamphetamine is a potent [[central nervous system]] [[stimulant]] that affects neurochemical mechanisms responsible for regulating heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, appetite, attention, mood and emotional responses associated with alertness or alarming conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schep&quot;/&gt; The acute physical effects of the drug closely resemble the physiological and psychological effects of an [[epinephrine]]-provoked [[fight-or-flight response]], including increased heart rate and blood pressure, [[vasoconstriction]] (constriction of the arterial walls), [[Bronchodilator|bronchodilation]], and [[hyperglycemia]] (increased blood sugar). Users experience an increase in focus, increased mental alertness, and the elimination of fatigue, as well as a decrease in appetite.

The [[methyl group]] is responsible for the potentiation of effects as compared to the related compound [[amphetamine]], rendering the substance on the one hand more [[lipophilicity|lipid-soluble]], enhancing transport across the [[blood-brain barrier]], and on the other hand more stable against enzymatic degradation by [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO).
Methamphetamine causes the [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]], and [[serotonin]] (5HT) transporters to reverse their direction of flow. This inversion leads to a release of these transmitters from the vesicles to the cytoplasm and from the cytoplasm to the synapse (releasing monoamines in rats with ratios of about [[Norepinephrine|NE]]:[[Dopamine|DA]] = 1:2, NE:[[5HT]]= 1:60), causing increased stimulation of post-synaptic receptors. Methamphetamine also indirectly prevents the reuptake of these neurotransmitters, causing them to remain in the synaptic cleft for a prolonged period (inhibiting monoamine reuptake in rats with ratios of about: NE:DA = 1:2.35, NE:5HT = 1:44.5).&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, et al. &quot;Amphetamine-Type Central Nervous System Potently than they Release Dopamine and Serotonin.&quot; (2001): Synapse ''39'', 32-41 (Table V. on page 37)&lt;/ref&gt;

Methamphetamine is a potent neurotoxin, shown to cause dopaminergic degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Itzhak Y, Martin JL, Ali SF |title=Methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice: long-lasting sensitization to the locomotor stimulation and desensitization to the rewarding effects of methamphetamine |journal=Progress in Neuro-psychopharmacology &amp; Biological Psychiatry |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=1177–83 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12452543 |doi=10.1016/S0278-5846(02)00257-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This corresponds to a human equivalent dose of at least 100 mg! Even higher on a simple mg/kg basis, which is probably a better measure for acute toxicity. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Davidson C, Gow AJ, Lee TH, Ellinwood EH |title=Methamphetamine neurotoxicity: necrotic and apoptotic mechanisms and relevance to human abuse and treatment |journal=Brain Research. Brain Research Reviews |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=1–22 |year=2001 |month=August |pmid=11516769 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0173(01)00054-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; High doses of methamphetamine produce losses in several markers of brain dopamine and serotonin neurons. Dopamine and serotonin concentrations, dopamine and 5HT uptake sites, and tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylase activities are reduced after the administration of methamphetamine. It has been proposed that dopamine plays a role in methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity, because experiments that reduce dopamine production or block the release of dopamine decrease the toxic effects of methamphetamine administration. When dopamine breaks down, it produces [[reactive oxygen species]] such as hydrogen peroxide.

It is likely that the approximate 1200% increase in dopamine levels and subsequent [[oxidative stress]] that occurs after taking methamphetamine mediates its [[neurotoxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Yamamoto BK, Zhu W |title=The effects of methamphetamine on the production of free radicals and oxidative stress |journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume=287 |issue=1 |pages=107–14 |year=1998 |month=October |pmid=9765328 |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9765328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacokinetics==
[[File:Methamphetamine pills.jpg|thumb|Illicit capsules and tablets containing methamphetamine]]

Following oral administration methamphetamine is readily absorbed with peak methamphetamine concentrations occurring in 3.13 to 6.3 hours post ingestion.

Methamphetamine is metabolized in the liver with the main metabolites being amphetamine (active) and 4-hydroxymethamphetamine; other minor metabolites include [[norpholedrine|4-hydroxyamphetamine]], [[norephedrine]], and 4-hydroxynorephedrine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schep&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid12507968&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Schepers RJ, Oyler JM, Joseph RE, Cone EJ, Moolchan ET, Huestis MA |title=Methamphetamine and amphetamine pharmacokinetics in oral fluid and plasma after controlled oral methamphetamine administration to human volunteers |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=121–32 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12507968 |doi=10.1373/49.1.121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;meth_metabolites_quant&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hendrickson H, Laurenzana E, Owens SM |title=Quantitative determination of total methamphetamine and active metabolites in rat tissue by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection |journal=The AAPS Journal |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=E709–17 |year=2006 |pmid=17233534 |pmc=2751367 |doi=10.1208/aapsj080480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other drugs metabolized to amphetamine and methamphetamine include [[benzphetamine]], [[furfenorex]], and [[famprofazone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marsel J, Döring G, Remberg G, Spiteller G |title=Methamphetamine--a metabolite of the anorectics Benzphetamine and Furfenorex |journal=Zeitschrift für Rechtsmedizin.

It is excreted by the kidneys, with the rate of excretion into the urine heavily influenced by urinary pH.

===Detection in biological fluids===
Methamphetamine and amphetamine are often measured in urine, sweat or saliva as part of a drug-abuse testing program, in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Chiral techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether obtained legally (via prescription) or illicitly, or possibly as a result of formation from a prodrug such as famprofazone or selegiline. Chiral separation is needed to assess the possible contribution of l-methamphetamine (Vicks Inhaler) toward a positive test result.&lt;ref&gt;de la Torre R, Farré M, Navarro M, Pacifici R, Zuccaro P, Pichini S.

==Tolerance==
As with other amphetamines, tolerance to methamphetamine is not completely understood but known to be sufficiently complex that it cannot be explained by any single mechanism. The extent of tolerance and the rate at which it develops vary widely between individuals, and, even within one person, it is highly dependent on dosage, duration of use, and frequency of administration. Tolerance to the awakening effect of amphetamines does not readily develop, making them suitable for the treatment of [[narcolepsy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GhodseBehavior&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ghodse | first = Hamid | title = Drugs and Addictive Behaviour: A Guide to Treatment | publisher = Cambridge University Press | pages = 114 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=3WF79shLxB4C&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage | isbn = 978-0521000017 | date = 2002-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short-term tolerance can be caused by depleted levels of [[neurotransmitters]] within the [[synaptic vesicle]]s available for release into the [[synaptic cleft]] following subsequent reuse ([[tachyphylaxis]]). Short-term tolerance typically lasts until neurotransmitter levels are fully replenished; because of the toxic effects on dopaminergic neurons, this can be greater than 2–3 days. Prolonged overstimulation of [[dopamine receptors]] caused by methamphetamine may eventually cause the receptors to [[downregulation|downregulate]] in order to compensate for increased levels of [[dopamine]] within the synaptic cleft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bennett BA, Hollingsworth CK, Martin RS, Harp JJ |title=Methamphetamine-induced alterations in dopamine transporter function |journal=Brain Research |volume=782 |issue=1-2 |pages=219–27 |year=1998 |month=January |pmid=9519266 |doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(97)01281-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; To compensate, larger quantities of the drug are needed in order to achieve the same level of effects.

[[Reverse tolerance]] or sensitization can also occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;GhodseBehavior&quot;/&gt; The effect is well established, but the mechanism is not well understood.

==Addiction==
Methamphetamine is [[Substance use disorder|addictive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camh.net/About_Addiction_Mental_Health/Drug_and_Addiction_Information/methamphetamine_dyk.html Do You Know... Methamphetamine]. Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.&lt;/ref&gt; While the withdrawal itself may not be dangerous, [[withdrawal symptoms|withdrawal]] symptoms are common with heavy use and [[relapse]] is common.

Methamphetamine-induced hyperstimulation of pleasure pathways leads to [[anhedonia]]. It is possible that daily administration of the amino acids L-[[Tyrosine]] and [[5-HTP|L-5HTP]]/[[Tryptophan]] can aid in the recovery process by making it easier for the body to reverse the depletion of [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]]. Although studies involving the use of these amino acids have shown some success, this method of recovery has not been shown to be consistently effective.

It is shown that taking [[ascorbic acid]] prior to using methamphetamine may help reduce acute toxicity to the brain, as rats given the human equivalent of 5–10&amp;nbsp;grams of ascorbic acid 30 minutes prior to methamphetamine dosage had toxicity mediated,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wagner GC, Carelli RM, Jarvis MF |title=Pretreatment with ascorbic acid attenuates the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine in rats |journal=Research Communications in Chemical Pathology and Pharmacology |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=221–8 |year=1985 |month=February |pmid=3992009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wagner GC, Carelli RM, Jarvis MF |title=Ascorbic acid reduces the dopamine depletion induced by methamphetamine and the 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium ion |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=559–61 |year=1986 |month=May |pmid=3488515 |doi=10.1016/0028-3908(86)90184-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet this will likely be of little avail in solving the other serious behavioral problems associated with methamphetamine use and addiction that many users experience. Large doses of ascorbic acid also lower urinary [[pH]], reducing methamphetamine's elimination [[half-life]] and thus decreasing the duration of its actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Oyler JM, Cone EJ, Joseph RE, Moolchan ET, Huestis MA |title=Duration of detectable methamphetamine and amphetamine excretion in urine after controlled oral administration of methamphetamine to humans |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=48 |issue=10 |pages=1703–14 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12324487 |url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12324487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat addiction, doctors are beginning to use other forms of [[stimulants]] such as [[dextroamphetamine]], the dextrorotatory (right-handed) isomer of the [[amphetamine]] molecule, to break the addiction cycle in a method similar to the use of [[methadone]] in the treatment of [[heroin]] addicts. There are no publicly available drugs comparable to [[naloxone]], which blocks opiate receptors and is therefore used in treating [[opiate]] dependence, for use with methamphetamine problems.&lt;ref&gt;The Ice Age (See Below)&lt;/ref&gt; However, experiments with some monoamine reuptake inhibitors such as [[indatraline]] have been successful in blocking the action of methamphetamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Rothman RB, Partilla JS, Baumann MH, Dersch CM, Carroll FI, Rice KC |title=Neurochemical neutralization of methamphetamine with high-affinity nonselective inhibitors of biogenic amine transporters: a pharmacological strategy for treating stimulant abuse |journal=Synapse |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=222–7 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10657029 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2396(20000301)35:3&lt;222::AID-SYN7&gt;3.0.CO;2-K}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are studies indicating that [[fluoxetine]], bupropion and imipramine may reduce craving and improve adherence to treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17990840&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Winslow BT, Voorhees KI, Pehl KA |title=Methamphetamine abuse |journal=American family physician |volume=76 |issue=8 |pages=1169–74 |year=2007 |pmid=17990840 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also suggested that [[modafinil]] can help addicts quit methamphetamine use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Grabowski J, Shearer J, Merrill J, Negus SS |title=Agonist-like, replacement pharmacotherapy for stimulant abuse and dependence |journal=Addictive Behaviors |volume=29 |issue=7 |pages=1439–64 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15345275 |doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2004.06.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Sleep medicine 'can help ice addicts quit' | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/12/01/2107027.htm | accessdate = 2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methamphetamine addiction is one of the most difficult forms of addictions to treat. [[Bupropion]], [[aripiprazole]], and  [[baclofen]] have been employed to treat post-withdrawal cravings, although the success rate is low. [[Modafinil]] is somewhat more successful, but this is a Class IV scheduled drug. [[Ibogaine]] has been used with success in Europe, where it is a Class I drug and available only for scientific research. [[Mirtazapine]] has been reported useful in some small-population studies.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini. ''Drugs of Abuse—Second Edition''. Los Angeles, Practice Management Information Company, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[phenethylamine]] [[phentermine]] is a constitutional isomer of methamphetamine, it has been suggested that it may be effective in treating methamphetamine addiction. Phentermine is a [[central nervous system]] stimulant that acts on [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]]. When comparing (+)-Amphetamine, (+/-)-ephedrine, and phentermine, one key difference among the three drugs is their selectivity for norepinephrine (NE) release vs. dopamine (DA) release. The NE/DA selectivity ratios for these drugs as determined in vitro [(EC(50) NE(-1))/(EC(50) DA(-1))] are (+/-)-ephedrine (18.6) &gt; phentermine (6.7) &gt; (+)-amphetamine (3.5).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amphetamines.com/misc/baboon.html Amphetamines.com | Noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects of (+)-amphetamine-like stimulants in the baboon Papio anubis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrupt interruption of chronic methamphetamine use results in the withdrawal syndrome in almost 90% of the cases.

The mental depression associated with methamphetamine withdrawal lasts longer and is more severe than that of [[cocaine]] withdrawal.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17990840&quot; /&gt;

==Medical use==
[[Image:Deux pilules de Desoxyn Gradumet 10mg.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Desoxyn 10&amp;nbsp;mg tablets ([[United States|US]])]]

Methamphetamine has been approved by the FDA for use in children and adults under the trademark name '''[http://www.lundbeckinc.com/USA/products/CNS/desoxyn/default.asp Desoxyn]'''. It is prescribed as a treatment for [[ADHD]] and [[exogenous obesity]] as well as [[off-label]] for the treatment of [[narcolepsy]] and [[treatment-resistant depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitler MM, Hajdukovic R, Erman MK 1993 306–17&quot;/&gt; Methamphetamine is known to produce [[central nervous system|central effects]] similar to other [[stimulants]], but at smaller doses, with fewer [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral effects]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turningpoint.org.au/library/cg_14.pdf Properties and effects of methamphetamine | Turning Point Alcohol and Drug Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; Methamphetamine's [[lipophilicity]] (fat solubility) also allows it to enter the brain faster than other stimulants where it is more stable against degradation by [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO).

===Other uses===
A 2006 study by a group of [[University of Montana]] scientists showed that methamphetamine appears to lessen damage to the brains of rats and gerbils that have suffered [[stroke]]s. Their preliminary research has found that small amounts of methamphetamine created a protective effect, while higher doses increased damage. The findings have shown that methamphetamine could be used medically to lessen stroke damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2006/10/12/um_study_meth_may_lessen_stroke_damage/ |title=UM study: Meth may lessen stroke damage |publisher=AP |date=2006-10-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5drWLLkEb |archivedate=2009-01-15 |accessdate=2008-06-29 }}

==Health issues==
===Meth mouth===
{{Main|Meth mouth}}
Methamphetamine users and addicts may lose their teeth abnormally quickly, a condition informally known as [[meth mouth]]. According to the [[American Dental Association]], meth mouth &quot;is probably caused by a combination of drug-induced psychological and physiological changes resulting in [[xerostomia]] (dry mouth), extended periods of poor [[oral hygiene]], frequent consumption of high-calorie, carbonated beverages and [[bruxism]] (teeth grinding and clenching).  Some reports have also speculated that the acidic nature of the drug is a contributing factor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADA&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080601035323/http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/topics/methmouth.asp |title=Methamphetamine Use (Meth Mouth) |accessdate=2006-12-16 |publisher=American Dental Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar, though far less severe, symptoms have been reported in clinical use of regular amphetamine, where effects are not exacerbated by extended periods of poor oral hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hasan AA, Ciancio S |title=Relationship between amphetamine ingestion and gingival enlargement |journal=Pediatric Dentistry |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=396–400 |year=2004 |pmid=15460293 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&amp;issn=0164-1263&amp;volume=26&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=396&amp;aulast=Hasan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Shaner JW |title=Caries associated with methamphetamine abuse |journal=The Journal of the Michigan Dental Association |volume=84 |issue=9 |pages=42–7 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12271905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hygiene===
Serious health and appearance problems can be caused by unsterilized needles, lack or ignoring of hygiene needs (more typical on chronic use), and obsessive skin-picking, which may lead to [[abscess]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17990840&quot;/&gt;

===Increased risk of sexually transmitted disease===
{{See also|Sex and drugs|Party and play}}
Men who use methamphetamine, [[cocaine]], [[MDMA]], and [[ketamine]] are twice as likely to have unprotected sex, according to British research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-1974.html PinkNews | Up to 20 per cent of gay men have tried crystal meth]&lt;/ref&gt; American [[psychologist]] [[Perry N. Halkitis]] performed an analysis using data collected from community-based participants among gay and bisexual men to examine the associations between methamphetamine use and sexual risk taking behaviors. Methamphetamine use was found to be related to higher frequencies of unprotected sexual intercourse in both HIV-positive and unknown casual partners. The association between methamphetamine use and unprotected acts were also more pronounced in HIV-positive participants. These findings suggested that methamphetamine use and engagement in unprotected anal intercourse are co-occurring risk behaviors that potentially heighten the risk of HIV transmission among gay and bisexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Methamphetamine allows users to engage in prolonged sexual activity, which may cause genital sores and abrasions. Methamphetamine can also cause sores and abrasions in the mouth via [[bruxism]] (teeth clenching and grinding), which can turn typically low-risk sex acts, such as oral sex, into high-risk sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-06-14/people/we-are-not-ok/ VillageVoice | We Are Not OK]&lt;/ref&gt; As with the injection of any drug, if a group of users [[needle sharing|share a common needle]] without sterilization procedures, blood-borne diseases, such as [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis]], can be transmitted. The level of needle sharing among methamphetamine users is similar to that among other drug injection users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.unsw.edu.au/NDARCWeb.nsf/resources/NDLERF_Methamphetamine/$file/NDLERF+USE+AND+HEALTH.pdf UNSW | Faculty of Medicine | Methamphetamine Use and Health]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Methamphetamine passes through the [[placenta]] and is secreted into breast milk. Infants born to methamphetamine-abusing mothers were found to have a significantly smaller [[gestational]] age-adjusted head circumference and birth weight measurements. Methamphetamine exposure was also associated with [[neonatal withdrawal]] symptoms of agitation, vomiting and [[tachypnea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15272773 Methamphetamine abuse during pregnancy and its health impact on neonates born at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. | PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt; This withdrawal syndrome is relatively mild and only requires medical intervention in approximately 4% of cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17990840&quot;/&gt;

===Public health issues===
Short-term exposure to high concentrations of chemical vapors that may exist in methamphetamine laboratories can cause severe health problems or even result in death. Exposure to these substances can occur from volatile air emissions, spills, fires, and explosions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5414a3.htm Acute Public Health Consequences of Methamphetamine Laboratories | Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC)]&lt;/ref&gt; Methamphetamine labs are often discovered when fire fighters respond to a blaze. Methamphetamine cooks, their families, and first responders are at highest risk of acute health effects from chemical exposure, including lung damage and chemical burns to the body. Following a seizure of a methamphetamine lab, there is often a low exposure risk to chemical residues, however this contamination should be sanitized. Chemical residues and lab wastes that are left behind at a former methamphetamine lab can result in health problems for people who use the property, therefore local health departments should thoroughly assess the property for hazards prior to allowing it to be re-inhabited, especially by children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HAC/pha/clandestine120704HC-WI/clandestine120704HC-WI.pdf Health Consultation | Agency for Toxic Substances &amp; Disease Registry (ATSDR)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Routes of administration==
Studies have shown that the subjective pleasure of drug use (the reinforcing component of addiction) is proportional to the rate at which the blood level of the drug increases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/301/2/690.full.pdf Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (JPET) | Onset of Action and Drug Reinforcement]&lt;/ref&gt; Intravenous injection is the fastest route of drug administration, causing blood concentrations to rise the most quickly, followed by smoking, [[suppository]] (anal or vaginal insertion), [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] (snorting), and [[ingestion]] (swallowing). Ingestion does not produce a [[Rush (psychology)|rush]], an [[Wiktionary:acute|acute]] [[Wiktionary:transcendent|transcendent]] state of [[euphoria]], as forerunner to the high experienced with the use of methamphetamine, which is most pronounced with intravenous use. While the onset of the rush induced by injection can occur in as little as a few seconds, the oral route of administration requires approximately half an hour before the high sets in. Thus, with both higher the dosage of methamphetamine used and faster the route of administration used, the higher potential risk for psychological addiction.

===Injection===
[[Drug injection|Injection]], also known as &quot;slamming&quot;, &quot;banging&quot;, &quot;shooting up&quot; or &quot;mainlining&quot;, is a popular method used by addicts which carries relatively greater risks than other methods of administration. The hydrochloride salt of methamphetamine is soluble in water. Intravenous users may use any dose range, from less than 100 [[milligram]]s to over one [[gram]], using a [[hypodermic needle]], although it should be noted that typically street methamphetamine is &quot;cut&quot; with a water-soluble cutting material, which constitutes a significant portion of a given street methamphetamine dose. Intravenous users risk developing [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE), a blockage of the main artery of the lung or one of its branches, and commonly develop skin rashes (also known as &quot;speed bumps&quot;) or infections at the site of injection. As with the injection of any drug, if a group of users [[needle sharing|share a common needle]] without sterilization procedures, blood-borne diseases, such as [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis]], can be transmitted.

===Smoking===
Smoking amphetamines refers to vaporizing it to inhale the resulting fumes, not burning it to inhale the resulting smoke. It is commonly smoked in glass pipes made from [[glassblowing|glassblown]] [[Pyrex|Pyrex tubes]] and light bulbs. It can also be smoked off aluminium foil, which is heated underneath by a flame. This method is also known as &quot;chasing the ''white'' dragon &quot; (whereas smoking [[heroin]] is known as &quot;[[chasing the dragon]]&quot;). There is little evidence that methamphetamine inhalation results in greater toxicity than any other route of administration. Lung damage has been reported with long-term use, but manifests in forms independent of route (pulmonary hypertension and associated complications), or limited to injection users (pulmonary emboli).

===Insufflation===
Another popular route to intake methamphetamine is insufflation (snorting), where a user crushes the methamphetamine into a fine powder and then sharply inhales it (sometimes with a straw or a rolled up [[banknote]], as with [[cocaine]]) into the nose where methamphetamine is absorbed through the soft tissue in the [[mucous membrane]] of the [[sinus cavity]] and straight into the bloodstream. This method of administration redirects [[first pass metabolism]], with a quicker onset and higher [[bioavailability]] than oral administration, though the duration of action is shortened. This method is sometimes preferred by users who do not want to prepare and administer methamphetamine for injection or smoking, but still experience a fast onset with a rush.

===Suppository===
Little research has been focused on the [[suppository]] (anal or vaginal insertion) method of administration. This method of administration is commonly administered using an [[oral syringe]]. Methamphetamine can be dissolved in water and withdrawn into an oral syringe which may then be lubricated and inserted into the anus or vagina before the plunger is pushed. Anecdotal evidence of its effects are infrequently discussed, possibly due to social taboos in many cultures. The rectum and the vaginal canal is where the majority of the drug would likely be taken up, through the membranes lining its walls. This method is often known within methamphetamine communities as a &quot;butt rocket&quot;, a &quot;booty bump&quot;, &quot;potato thumping&quot;, &quot;turkey basting&quot;, &quot;plugging&quot;, &quot;keistering&quot;, &quot;shafting&quot;, &quot;bumming&quot; and &quot;shelving&quot; (vaginal). It is anecdotally reported to increase sexual pleasure, while the effects of the drug last longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citypages.com/databank/24/1171/article11254.asp Meth Myths, Meth Realities]{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As methamphetamine is [[central nervous system|centrally active]] in the brain, these effects are likely experienced through the higher bioavailability of the drug in the bloodstream (second to injection) and the faster onset of action (than insufflation).

==Illicit production==
[[Image:Méthamphétamine pure.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Crystal]] methamphetamine]]
===Synthesis===
Synthesis is relatively simple, but entails risk with flammable and corrosive chemicals, particularly the solvents used in extraction and purification, therefore illicit production is often discovered by fires and explosions caused by the improper handling of volatile or flammable solvents. Most of the necessary chemicals are readily available in household products or [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] cold or allergy medicines. When illicitly produced, methamphetamine is commonly made by the [[Redox|reduction]] of [[ephedrine]] or [[pseudoephedrine]]. The maximum conversion rate for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine is 92%, though typically, illicit methamphetamine laboratories convert at a rate of 50% to 75%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.ucsc.edu/~cdobkin/Papers/Methamphetamine.pdf The War on Drugs: Methamphetamine, Public Health, and Crime | University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most methods of illicit production involve [[protonation]] of the [[hydroxyl]] group on the [[ephedrine]] or [[pseudoephedrine]] molecule. Methamphetamine is most structurally similar to [[methcathinone]] and [[amphetamine]]. The most common method for small-scale methamphetamine labs in the United States is primarily called the &quot;Red, White, and Blue Process&quot;, which involves red [[phosphorus]], [[pseudoephedrine]] or [[ephedrine]] (white), and blue [[iodine]] (which is technically a purple color in elemental form), from which [[Hydrogen iodide|hydroiodic acid]] is formed. In Australia, criminal groups have been known to substitute &quot;red&quot; phosphorus with either hypophosphorous acid or phosphorous acid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pacia.org.au/_uploaditems/docs/2.code_illicitdrugmanufsept05.pdf PACIA.org.au]{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a hazardous process for amateur chemists, because [[phosphine]] gas, a side-product from [[in situ#Chemistry and chemical engineering|in situ]] hydroiodic acid production, is extremely toxic to inhale.

Another common method uses the [[Birch reduction]] (also called the &quot;Nagai method&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/methnet/understandingmeth/basics.html Illinois Attorney General | Basic Understanding Of Meth]&lt;/ref&gt; in which metallic [[lithium]], commonly extracted from non-rechargeable [[Lithium battery|lithium batteries]], is substituted for difficult-to-find metallic [[sodium]]. However, the Birch reduction is dangerous because the alkali metal and liquid [[anhydrous ammonia]] are both extremely reactive, and the temperature of liquid ammonia makes it susceptible to explosive boiling when reactants are added.

A completely different procedure of synthesis uses the [[reductive amination]] of [[phenylacetone]] with [[methylamine]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/amph.alhg.html A Synthesis of Amphetamine. J. Chem. Educ. 51, 671 (1974)]&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are currently [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] [[DEA list I chemicals|list I]] chemicals (as are pseudoephedrine and ephedrine). The reaction requires a catalyst that acts as a reducing agent, such as [[mercury-aluminum amalgam]] or platinum dioxide, also known as [[Adams' catalyst]]. This was once the preferred method of production by [[motorcycle gangs]] in [[California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8lWBixJv0QAC |title=No Speed Limit: The Highs and Lows of Meth |first=Frank |last=Owen |publisher=Macmillan |year=2007 |isbn=9780312356163 |chapter=Chapter 1: The Rise of Nazi Dope |pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; until DEA restrictions on the chemicals made the process difficult. Other less common methods use other means of hydrogenation, such as [[hydrogen]] [[gas]] in the presence of a [[catalyst]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Methamphetamine labs can give off noxious fumes, such as [[phosphine]] gas, [[methylamine]] gas, solvent vapors, [[acetone]] or [[chloroform]], [[iodine]] vapors, white [[phosphorus]], anhydrous [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen chloride]]/[[muriatic acid]], [[hydrogen iodide]], [[lithium]]/[[sodium]] metal, [[ether]], or methamphetamine vapors. If performed by amateurs, manufacturing methamphetamine can be extremely dangerous. If the red [[phosphorus]] overheats, because of a lack of ventilation, phosphine gas can be produced. This gas is highly toxic and, if present in large quantities, is likely to explode upon autoignition from [[diphosphine]], which is formed by overheating [[phosphorus]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In recent years, reports of a simplified &quot;Shake 'n Bake&quot; synthesis have surfaced. The method is suitable for such small batches that pseudoephedrine restrictions are less effective, it uses chemicals that are easier to obtain (though no less dangerous than traditional methods), and it is so easy to carry out that some addicts have made the drug while driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/health/2009/08/25/2009-08-25_new_method_for_making_crystal_meth_gets_around_drug_laws.html |title=New 'shake-and-bake' method for making crystal meth gets around drug laws but is no less dangerous |author=Associated Press |publisher=New York Daily News |date=August 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producing methamphetamine in this fashion can be extremely dangerous and has been linked to several fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alcoholism.about.com/od/meth/a/shake_and_bake.htm |title=Shake and Bake Meth | New 'Shake and Bake' Meth Method Explodes |accessdate=2009-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production and distribution===
[[Image:methjakarta.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Industrial-scale methamphetamine factory in Cikande, [[Indonesia]].]]
Until the early 1990s, methamphetamine for the U.S. market was made mostly in labs run by drug traffickers in [[Mexico]] and [[California]]. Since then, authorities{{Which?|date=July 2009}} have discovered increasing numbers of small-scale methamphetamine labs all over the United States, mostly in rural, suburban, or low-income areas.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} [[Indiana]] [[state police]] found 1,260 labs in 2003, compared to just 6 in 1995, although this may be partly a result of increased police activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070926225227/http://www.in.gov/cji/methfreeindiana/enforce.html Law Enforcement Facts, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, drug and lab seizure data suggests that approximately 80 percent of the methamphetamine used in the United States originates from larger laboratories operated by Mexican-based syndicates on both sides of the border and that approximately 20 percent comes from small toxic labs (STLs) in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Mobile and motel-based methamphetamine labs have caught the attention of both the U.S. news media and the police. Such labs can cause explosions and fires and expose the public to hazardous chemicals. Those who manufacture methamphetamine are often harmed by toxic gases. Many police departments have specialized task forces with training to respond to cases of methamphetamine production. The National Drug Threat Assessment 2006, produced by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], found &quot;decreased domestic methamphetamine production in both small and large-scale laboratories&quot;, but also that &quot;decreases in domestic methamphetamine production have been offset by increased production in Mexico.&quot; They concluded that &quot;methamphetamine availability is not likely to decline in the near term.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/ndic/pubs11/18862/meth.htm |title=Methamphetamine | National Drug Threat Assessment 2006 |accessdate=2009-08-25 |date = January 2006|publisher=National Drug Intelligence Center }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, Mexican officials at the port of [[Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán|Lázaro Cárdenas]] seized a ship carrying 19 tons of [[pseudoephedrine]], a raw material needed for methamphetamine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetelegram.com/index.cfm?pid=1154&amp;cpcat=world&amp;stry=59519030 Mexico says pseudoephedrine case signals breakdown in port security in U.S., China] AP, The Telegram (The Canadian Press), July 26, 2007. Olga R. Rodriguez&lt;/ref&gt; The shipment originated in [[Hong Kong]] and passed through the United States at the port of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] prior to its arrival in Mexico.

Methamphetamine is distributed by prison gangs, [[Outlaw motorcycle club|outlaw motorcycle gangs]], street gangs, traditional [[organized crime]] operations, and impromptu small networks.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In the United States, illicit methamphetamine comes in a variety of forms with prices varying widely over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/price_purity/ The Price and Purity of Illicit Drugs: 1981 Through the Second Quarter of 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, it is found as a colorless [[Wiktionary:crystalline|crystalline]] solid. Impurities may result in a brownish or tan color. Colorful flavored pills containing methamphetamine and [[caffeine]] are known as [[yaba (drug)|yaa baa]] (Thai for &quot;crazy medicine&quot;).

An impure form of methamphetamine is sold as a crumbly brown or off-white rock, commonly referred to as &quot;peanut butter crank&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

Another popular method is to combine methamphetamine with other [[stimulant|stimulant substances]], such as [[caffeine]] or [[cathine]], into a pill known as a &quot;Kamikaze&quot;, which can be particularly dangerous due to the [[synergistic|synergistic effects]] of multiple stimulants. It may also be flavored with high-sugar candies, drinks, or drink mixes to mask the bitter taste of the drug. Coloring may be added to the meth, as is the case with &quot;Strawberry Quick&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/02/health/main2752266.shtml Candy Flavored Meth Targets New Users] CBS News, May 2, 2007.

==Natural occurrence==
Methamphetamine has been reported to occur naturally in ''[[Acacia berlandieri]]'', and possibly ''[[Acacia rigidula]]'', trees that grow in [[West Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;BA Clement, CM Goff, TDA Forbes, Phytochemistry Vol.49, No 5, pp 1377–1380 (1998) &quot;Toxic amines and alkaloids from Acacia rigidula&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Methamphetamine and regular amphetamine were long thought to be strictly human-synthesized,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/shulgin/adsarchive/acacia.htm Ask Dr. Shulgin Online: Acacias and Natural Amphetamine]&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Acacia'' trees contain these and numerous other psychoactive compounds (e.g., [[mescaline]], [[nicotine]], [[dimethyltryptamine]]), and the related compound [[Phenethylamine|β-phenethylamine]] is known to occur from numerous ''Acacia'' species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Siegler, D.S.|title=Phytochemistry of ''Acacia—sensu lato'' |journal= Biochemical Systematics and Ecology |volume=31 |issue=8 |pages=845–873 |year=2003 |month=August |doi=10.1016/S0305-1978(03)00082-6 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings, however, have never been confirmed or repeated, leading some researchers to believe the results were the result of cross-contamination.

==Terminology==
[[Slang|Nicknames]] for methamphetamine are numerous and vary significantly from region to region. Some common nicknames for methamphetamine include &quot;ice&quot;, &quot;meth&quot;, &quot;crystal&quot;, &quot;crystal meth&quot;, &quot;crank&quot;, &quot;glass&quot;, &quot;chalk&quot;, &quot;fire&quot;, &quot;go-fast&quot;, &quot;tweak&quot;, &quot;nazi dope&quot;, &quot;jack&quot; and &quot;jib&quot; ([[United States and Canada]]), &quot;shabu&quot; ([[Japan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]]), &quot;tik&quot; ([[South Africa]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;UCT&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|work=UCT|accessdate=2009-08-13 |last=Plüddemann|first=Andreas| date=2005-06|title=Tik, memory loss and stroke|journal=Science in Africa|publisher=Science magazine for Africa CC|location=South Africa|url=http://www.scienceinafrica.co.za/2005/june/tik.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Sissonville Slim Fast&quot; ([[West Virginia]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-13890695.html Encyclopedia.com | Meth awareness meeting planned for Sissonville: Community to get information to fight drug problem.]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[ya ba]]&quot; ([[Thailand]]), and &quot;P&quot; ([[New Zealand]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police.govt.nz/safety/meth.html New Zealand Police | What is methamphetamine?]&lt;/ref&gt; The nickname most commonly used in the [[gay community]] is &quot;Tina&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/cs/healthfitness/a/crystal.htm About.com: Gay Life | Crystal Methamphetamine]&lt;/ref&gt; Methamphetamine may also be referred to as &quot;speed&quot;, a term that is commonly used for regular [[amphetamine]] without the [[methyl group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrodrug.org/drugs/methamphetamine.aspx Metropolitan Drug Commission | Methamphetamine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
{{Main|Legal status of methamphetamine}}
The production, distribution, sale, and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or illegal in many [[jurisdiction]]s. Methamphetamine has been placed in schedule II of the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |title=List of psychotropic substances under international control |accessdate=2010-05-10 |format=PDF |publisher=International Narcotics Control Board }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Please add only information that contributes to the general, global overview of legality.

==History==
[[Image:Blue Crystal Meth .jpg|left|thumb|[[Crystal]] methamphetamine was first [[Wiktionary:synthesize|synthesized]] in 1919 by [[Akira Ogata]].]]
Methamphetamine was first synthesized from [[ephedrine]] in Japan in 1893 by chemist [[Nagai Nagayoshi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110003609935/|author =Nagai N.|title = Kanyaku maou seibun kenkyuu seiseki (zoku)|journal= Yakugaku Zasshi |year=1893|volume= 127|pages= 832–860}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, crystallized methamphetamine was synthesized by [[Akira Ogata]] via [[redox|reduction]] of [[ephedrine]] using red [[phosphorus]] and [[iodine]]. In 1943, [[Abbott Laboratories]] requested for its approval from the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for the treatment of [[narcolepsy]], mild [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[postencephalitic parkinsonism]], chronic [[alcoholism]], cerebral [[arteriosclerosis]], and [[Allergic rhinitis|hay fever]]. Methamphetamine was approved for all of these indications in December, 1944.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} All of these indication approvals were eventually removed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The only two approved marketing indications remaining for methamphetamine are for [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and the short-term management of [[exogenous obesity]], although the drug is clinically established as effective in the treatment of [[narcolepsy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitler MM, Hajdukovic R, Erman MK 1993 306–17&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mitler MM, Hajdukovic R, Erman MK |title=Treatment of narcolepsy with methamphetamine |journal=Sleep |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=306–17 |year=1993 |month=June |pmid=8341891 |pmc=2267865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, methamphetamine was sold under the registered trademark of {{Nihongo|Philopon|ヒロポン|hiropon}} by [[Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma]] for civilian and military use. Similar to the situation in the rest of the world, the side effects of methamphetamine were not well studied, and regulation was not seen as necessary.

After World War II, a large Japanese military stockpile of methamphetamine, known by its trademark Philopon, flooded the market.&lt;ref name=Philopon&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://web.archive.org/web/20071221115601/http://www.yama-arashi.com/medical/antidepressants.htm | title = 抗うつ薬いろいろ (Various Antidepressants) | accessdate = 2006-07-14 | author = Digital Creators Studio Yama-Arashi | date=  2006-04-16 | work = 医療情報提供サービス | language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese Ministry of Health banned it in 1951; since then, it has been increasingly produced by the [[Yakuza]] criminal organization.&lt;ref name=banning_in_1951&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1989-01-01_1_page007.html | title = Japan: stimulant epidemics past and present | accessdate = 14 July 2006 | author = M.

In the 1950s, there was a rise in the legal prescription of methamphetamine to the American public. In the 1954 edition of ''Pharmacology and Therapeutics'', indications for methamphetamine included &quot;[[narcolepsy]], [[Encephalitis|postencephalitic]] [[parkinsonism]], [[alcoholism]], certain [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] states, and in the treatment of [[obesity]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Grollman | first = Arthur | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Pharmacology and Therapeutics: a Textbook for Students and Practitioners of Medicine | publisher = Lea &amp; Febiger | year = 1954 | location = | pages = 209 | isbn = 0812101057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s saw the start of significant use of clandestinely manufactured methamphetamine as well as methamphetamine created in users' own homes for personal use. The recreational use of methamphetamine continues to this day.

===Legal restrictions===
{{See also|#Legality|l1=Legality}}
In 1983, laws were passed in the United States prohibiting possession of precursors and equipment for methamphetamine production. This was followed a month later by a bill passed in Canada enacting similar laws. In 1986, the U.S. government passed the Federal Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act in an attempt to curb the growing use of [[designer drug]]s. Despite this, use of methamphetamine expanded throughout rural United States, especially through the Midwest and South.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/209730.pdf Methamphetamine Use: Lessons Learned | National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1989, five U.S. federal laws and dozens of state laws have been imposed in an attempt to curb the production of methamphetamine. Methamphetamine can be produced in home laboratories using pseudoephedrine or ephedrine, which, at the time, were the active ingredients in over-the-counter drugs such as [[Sudafed]] and [[Contac]]. Preventive legal strategies of the past 17 years have steadily increased restrictions to the distribution of pseudoephedrine/ephedrine-containing products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunningham JK 2003&quot;&gt;Cunningham JK, Liu LM. (2003) Impacts of Federal ephedrine and pseudoephedrine regulations on methamphetamine-related hospital admissions. Addiction, 98, 1229–1237.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the U.S. [[Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005]], a subsection of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], there are restrictions on the amount of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine one may purchase in a specified time period and further requirements that these products must be stored in order to prevent theft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunningham JK 2003&quot;/&gt; Increasingly strict restrictions have resulted in the reformulation of many over-the-counter drugs, and some, such as [[Actifed]], have been discontinued entirely in the United States.

==Pharmacology==
A member of the family of [[phenethylamine]]s, methamphetamine is [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]], with two [[isomer]]s, [[levorotary]] and [[dextrorotatory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schep&quot;/&gt; The levorotary form, called [[levomethamphetamine]], is an [[over-the-counter drug]] used in [[inhaler]]s for nasal decongestion. Levomethamphetamine does not possess any significant [[central nervous system]] activity or [[Substance use disorder|addictive]] properties. This article deals only with the dextrorotatory form, called [[dextromethamphetamine (medical)|dextromethamphetamine]], and the [[racemic]] form.

Methamphetamine is a potent [[central nervous system]] [[stimulant]] that affects neurochemical mechanisms responsible for regulating heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, appetite, attention, mood and emotional responses associated with alertness or alarming conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schep&quot;/&gt; The acute physical effects of the drug closely resemble the physiological and psychological effects of an [[epinephrine]]-provoked [[fight-or-flight response]], including increased heart rate and blood pressure, [[vasoconstriction]] (constriction of the arterial walls), [[Bronchodilator|bronchodilation]], and [[hyperglycemia]] (increased blood sugar). Users experience an increase in focus, increased mental alertness, and the elimination of fatigue, as well as a decrease in appetite.

The [[methyl group]] is responsible for the potentiation of effects as compared to the related compound [[amphetamine]], rendering the substance on the one hand more [[lipophilicity|lipid-soluble]], enhancing transport across the [[blood-brain barrier]], and on the other hand more stable against enzymatic degradation by [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO).
Methamphetamine causes the [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]], and [[serotonin]] (5HT) transporters to reverse their direction of flow. This inversion leads to a release of these transmitters from the vesicles to the cytoplasm and from the cytoplasm to the synapse (releasing monoamines in rats with ratios of about [[Norepinephrine|NE]]:[[Dopamine|DA]] = 1:2, NE:[[5HT]]= 1:60), causing increased stimulation of post-synaptic receptors. Methamphetamine also indirectly prevents the reuptake of these neurotransmitters, causing them to remain in the synaptic cleft for a prolonged period (inhibiting monoamine reuptake in rats with ratios of about: NE:DA = 1:2.35, NE:5HT = 1:44.5).&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, et al. &quot;Amphetamine-Type Central Nervous System Potently than they Release Dopamine and Serotonin.&quot; (2001): Synapse ''39'', 32-41 (Table V. on page 37)&lt;/ref&gt;

Methamphetamine is a potent neurotoxin, shown to cause dopaminergic degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Itzhak Y, Martin JL, Ali SF |title=Methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice: long-lasting sensitization to the locomotor stimulation and desensitization to the rewarding effects of methamphetamine |journal=Progress in Neuro-psychopharmacology &amp; Biological Psychiatry |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=1177–83 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12452543 |doi=10.1016/S0278-5846(02)00257-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This corresponds to a human equivalent dose of at least 100 mg!

Dopamine and serotonin concentrations, dopamine and 5HT uptake sites, and tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylase activities are reduced after the administration of methamphetamine. It has been proposed that dopamine plays a role in methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity, because experiments that reduce dopamine production or block the release of dopamine decrease the toxic effects of methamphetamine administration. When dopamine breaks down, it produces [[reactive oxygen species]] such as hydrogen peroxide.

It is likely that the approximate 1200% increase in dopamine levels and subsequent [[oxidative stress]] that occurs after taking methamphetamine mediates its [[neurotoxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Yamamoto BK, Zhu W |title=The effects of methamphetamine on the production of free radicals and oxidative stress |journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume=287 |issue=1 |pages=107–14 |year=1998 |month=October |pmid=9765328 |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9765328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdrawal effects===
Withdrawal symptoms of methamphetamine primarily consist of mental [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], mental [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and an increased [[appetite]]. Symptoms may last for days with occasional use and weeks or months with chronic use, with severity dependent on the length of time and the amount of methamphetamine used.

==Pharmacokinetics==
[[File:Methamphetamine pills.jpg|thumb|Illicit capsules and tablets containing methamphetamine]]

Following oral administration methamphetamine is readily absorbed with peak methamphetamine concentrations occurring in 3.13 to 6.3 hours post ingestion. The amphetamine metabolite peaks at 10 to 24 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schep&quot;/&gt; Methamphetamine is also well absorbed following inhalation and following intranasal administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schep&quot;/&gt; It is [[Distribution (pharmacology)|distributed]] to most parts of the body. Because methamphetamine has a high [[lipophilicity]] it is distributed across the [[blood brain barrier]] and crosses the placenta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schep&quot;/&gt;

Methamphetamine is metabolized in the liver with the main metabolites being amphetamine (active) and 4-hydroxymethamphetamine; other minor metabolites include [[norpholedrine|4-hydroxyamphetamine]], [[norephedrine]], and 4-hydroxynorephedrine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schep&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid12507968&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Schepers RJ, Oyler JM, Joseph RE, Cone EJ, Moolchan ET, Huestis MA |title=Methamphetamine and amphetamine pharmacokinetics in oral fluid and plasma after controlled oral methamphetamine administration to human volunteers |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=121–32 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12507968 |doi=10.1373/49.1.121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;meth_metabolites_quant&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hendrickson H, Laurenzana E, Owens SM |title=Quantitative determination of total methamphetamine and active metabolites in rat tissue by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection |journal=The AAPS Journal |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=E709–17 |year=2006 |pmid=17233534 |pmc=2751367 |doi=10.1208/aapsj080480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other drugs metabolized to amphetamine and methamphetamine include [[benzphetamine]], [[furfenorex]], and [[famprofazone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marsel J, Döring G, Remberg G, Spiteller G |title=Methamphetamine--a metabolite of the anorectics Benzphetamine and Furfenorex |journal=Zeitschrift für Rechtsmedizin.

It is excreted by the kidneys, with the rate of excretion into the urine heavily influenced by urinary pH. Between 30-54% of an oral dose is excreted in urine as unchanged methamphetamine and 10-23% as unchanged amphetamine.

===Detection in biological fluids===
Methamphetamine and amphetamine are often measured in urine, sweat or saliva as part of a drug-abuse testing program, in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Chiral techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether obtained legally (via prescription) or illicitly, or possibly as a result of formation from a prodrug such as famprofazone or selegiline. Chiral separation is needed to assess the possible contribution of l-methamphetamine (Vicks Inhaler) toward a positive test result.&lt;ref&gt;de la Torre R, Farré M, Navarro M, Pacifici R, Zuccaro P, Pichini S.

==Tolerance==
As with other amphetamines, tolerance to methamphetamine is not completely understood but known to be sufficiently complex that it cannot be explained by any single mechanism. The extent of tolerance and the rate at which it develops vary widely between individuals, and, even within one person, it is highly dependent on dosage, duration of use, and frequency of administration. Tolerance to the awakening effect of amphetamines does not readily develop, making them suitable for the treatment of [[narcolepsy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GhodseBehavior&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ghodse | first = Hamid | title = Drugs and Addictive Behaviour: A Guide to Treatment | publisher = Cambridge University Press | pages = 114 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=3WF79shLxB4C&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage | isbn = 978-0521000017 | date = 2002-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short-term tolerance can be caused by depleted levels of [[neurotransmitters]] within the [[synaptic vesicle]]s available for release into the [[synaptic cleft]] following subsequent reuse ([[tachyphylaxis]]). Short-term tolerance typically lasts until neurotransmitter levels are fully replenished; because of the toxic effects on dopaminergic neurons, this can be greater than 2–3 days. Prolonged overstimulation of [[dopamine receptors]] caused by methamphetamine may eventually cause the receptors to [[downregulation|downregulate]] in order to compensate for increased levels of [[dopamine]] within the synaptic cleft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bennett BA, Hollingsworth CK, Martin RS, Harp JJ |title=Methamphetamine-induced alterations in dopamine transporter function |journal=Brain Research |volume=782 |issue=1-2 |pages=219–27 |year=1998 |month=January |pmid=9519266 |doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(97)01281-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; To compensate, larger quantities of the drug are needed in order to achieve the same level of effects.

[[Reverse tolerance]] or sensitization can also occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;GhodseBehavior&quot;/&gt; The effect is well established, but the mechanism is not well understood.

==Addiction==
Methamphetamine is [[Substance use disorder|addictive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camh.net/About_Addiction_Mental_Health/Drug_and_Addiction_Information/methamphetamine_dyk.html Do You Know... Methamphetamine]. Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.&lt;/ref&gt; While the withdrawal itself may not be dangerous, [[withdrawal symptoms|withdrawal]] symptoms are common with heavy use and [[relapse]] is common.

Methamphetamine-induced hyperstimulation of pleasure pathways leads to [[anhedonia]]. It is possible that daily administration of the amino acids L-[[Tyrosine]] and [[5-HTP|L-5HTP]]/[[Tryptophan]] can aid in the recovery process by making it easier for the body to reverse the depletion of [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]]. Although studies involving the use of these amino acids have shown some success, this method of recovery has not been shown to be consistently effective.

To combat addiction, doctors are beginning to use other forms of [[stimulants]] such as [[dextroamphetamine]], the dextrorotatory (right-handed) isomer of the [[amphetamine]] molecule, to break the addiction cycle in a method similar to the use of [[methadone]] in the treatment of [[heroin]] addicts. There are no publicly available drugs comparable to [[naloxone]], which blocks opiate receptors and is therefore used in treating [[opiate]] dependence, for use with methamphetamine problems.&lt;ref&gt;The Ice Age (See Below)&lt;/ref&gt; However, experiments with some monoamine reuptake inhibitors such as [[indatraline]] have been successful in blocking the action of methamphetamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Rothman RB, Partilla JS, Baumann MH, Dersch CM, Carroll FI, Rice KC |title=Neurochemical neutralization of methamphetamine with high-affinity nonselective inhibitors of biogenic amine transporters: a pharmacological strategy for treating stimulant abuse |journal=Synapse |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=222–7 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10657029 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2396(20000301)35:3&lt;222::AID-SYN7&gt;3.0.CO;2-K}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are studies indicating that [[fluoxetine]], bupropion and imipramine may reduce craving and improve adherence to treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17990840&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Winslow BT, Voorhees KI, Pehl KA |title=Methamphetamine abuse |journal=American family physician |volume=76 |issue=8 |pages=1169–74 |year=2007 |pmid=17990840 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also suggested that [[modafinil]] can help addicts quit methamphetamine use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Grabowski J, Shearer J, Merrill J, Negus SS |title=Agonist-like, replacement pharmacotherapy for stimulant abuse and dependence |journal=Addictive Behaviors |volume=29 |issue=7 |pages=1439–64 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15345275 |doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2004.06.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Sleep medicine 'can help ice addicts quit' | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/12/01/2107027.htm | accessdate = 2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methamphetamine addiction is one of the most difficult forms of addictions to treat. [[Bupropion]], [[aripiprazole]], and  [[baclofen]] have been employed to treat post-withdrawal cravings, although the success rate is low. [[Modafinil]] is somewhat more successful, but this is a Class IV scheduled drug. [[Ibogaine]] has been used with success in Europe, where it is a Class I drug and available only for scientific research. [[Mirtazapine]] has been reported useful in some small-population studies.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini. ''Drugs of Abuse—Second Edition''. Los Angeles, Practice Management Information Company, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[phenethylamine]] [[phentermine]] is a constitutional isomer of methamphetamine, it has been suggested that it may be effective in treating methamphetamine addiction. Phentermine is a [[central nervous system]] stimulant that acts on [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]]. When comparing (+)-Amphetamine, (+/-)-ephedrine, and phentermine, one key difference among the three drugs is their selectivity for norepinephrine (NE) release vs. dopamine (DA) release. The NE/DA selectivity ratios for these drugs as determined in vitro [(EC(50) NE(-1))/(EC(50) DA(-1))] are (+/-)-ephedrine (18.6) &gt; phentermine (6.7) &gt; (+)-amphetamine (3.5).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amphetamines.com/misc/baboon.html Amphetamines.com | Noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects of (+)-amphetamine-like stimulants in the baboon Papio anubis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrupt interruption of chronic methamphetamine use results in the withdrawal syndrome in almost 90% of the cases.

The mental depression associated with methamphetamine withdrawal lasts longer and is more severe than that of [[cocaine]] withdrawal.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17990840&quot; /&gt;

==Medical use==
[[Image:Deux pilules de Desoxyn Gradumet 10mg.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Desoxyn 10&amp;nbsp;mg tablets ([[United States|US]])]]

Methamphetamine has been approved by the FDA for use in children and adults under the trademark name '''[http://www.lundbeckinc.com/USA/products/CNS/desoxyn/default.asp Desoxyn]'''. It is prescribed as a treatment for [[ADHD]] and [[exogenous obesity]] as well as [[off-label]] for the treatment of [[narcolepsy]] and [[treatment-resistant depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitler MM, Hajdukovic R, Erman MK 1993 306–17&quot;/&gt; Methamphetamine is known to produce [[central nervous system|central effects]] similar to other [[stimulants]], but at smaller doses, with fewer [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral effects]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turningpoint.org.au/library/cg_14.pdf Properties and effects of methamphetamine | Turning Point Alcohol and Drug Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; Methamphetamine's [[lipophilicity]] (fat solubility) also allows it to enter the brain faster than other stimulants where it is more stable against degradation by [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO).

===Other uses===
A 2006 study by a group of [[University of Montana]] scientists showed that methamphetamine appears to lessen damage to the brains of rats and gerbils that have suffered [[stroke]]s. Their preliminary research has found that small amounts of methamphetamine created a protective effect, while higher doses increased damage. The findings have shown that methamphetamine could be used medically to lessen stroke damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2006/10/12/um_study_meth_may_lessen_stroke_damage/ |title=UM study: Meth may lessen stroke damage |publisher=AP |date=2006-10-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5drWLLkEb |archivedate=2009-01-15 |accessdate=2008-06-29 }}

==Health issues==
===Meth mouth===
{{Main|Meth mouth}}
Methamphetamine users and addicts may lose their teeth abnormally quickly, a condition informally known as [[meth mouth]]. According to the [[American Dental Association]], meth mouth &quot;is probably caused by a combination of drug-induced psychological and physiological changes resulting in [[xerostomia]] (dry mouth), extended periods of poor [[oral hygiene]], frequent consumption of high-calorie, carbonated beverages and [[bruxism]] (teeth grinding and clenching).  Some reports have also speculated that the acidic nature of the drug is a contributing factor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADA&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080601035323/http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/topics/methmouth.asp |title=Methamphetamine Use (Meth Mouth) |accessdate=2006-12-16 |publisher=American Dental Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar, though far less severe, symptoms have been reported in clinical use of regular amphetamine, where effects are not exacerbated by extended periods of poor oral hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hasan AA, Ciancio S |title=Relationship between amphetamine ingestion and gingival enlargement |journal=Pediatric Dentistry |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=396–400 |year=2004 |pmid=15460293 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&amp;issn=0164-1263&amp;volume=26&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=396&amp;aulast=Hasan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Shaner JW |title=Caries associated with methamphetamine abuse |journal=The Journal of the Michigan Dental Association |volume=84 |issue=9 |pages=42–7 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12271905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hygiene===
Serious health and appearance problems can be caused by unsterilized needles, lack or ignoring of hygiene needs (more typical on chronic use), and obsessive skin-picking, which may lead to [[abscess]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17990840&quot;/&gt;

===Increased risk of sexually transmitted disease===
{{See also|Sex and drugs|Party and play}}
Men who use methamphetamine, [[cocaine]], [[MDMA]], and [[ketamine]] are twice as likely to have unprotected sex, according to British research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-1974.html PinkNews | Up to 20 per cent of gay men have tried crystal meth]&lt;/ref&gt; American [[psychologist]] [[Perry N. Halkitis]] performed an analysis using data collected from community-based participants among gay and bisexual men to examine the associations between methamphetamine use and sexual risk taking behaviors. Methamphetamine use was found to be related to higher frequencies of unprotected sexual intercourse in both HIV-positive and unknown casual partners. The association between methamphetamine use and unprotected acts were also more pronounced in HIV-positive participants. These findings suggested that methamphetamine use and engagement in unprotected anal intercourse are co-occurring risk behaviors that potentially heighten the risk of HIV transmission among gay and bisexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Methamphetamine allows users to engage in prolonged sexual activity, which may cause genital sores and abrasions. Methamphetamine can also cause sores and abrasions in the mouth via [[bruxism]] (teeth clenching and grinding), which can turn typically low-risk sex acts, such as oral sex, into high-risk sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-06-14/people/we-are-not-ok/ VillageVoice | We Are Not OK]&lt;/ref&gt; As with the injection of any drug, if a group of users [[needle sharing|share a common needle]] without sterilization procedures, blood-borne diseases, such as [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis]], can be transmitted. The level of needle sharing among methamphetamine users is similar to that among other drug injection users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.unsw.edu.au/NDARCWeb.nsf/resources/NDLERF_Methamphetamine/$file/NDLERF+USE+AND+HEALTH.pdf UNSW | Faculty of Medicine | Methamphetamine Use and Health]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Methamphetamine passes through the [[placenta]] and is secreted into breast milk. Infants born to methamphetamine-abusing mothers were found to have a significantly smaller [[gestational]] age-adjusted head circumference and birth weight measurements. Methamphetamine exposure was also associated with [[neonatal withdrawal]] symptoms of agitation, vomiting and [[tachypnea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15272773 Methamphetamine abuse during pregnancy and its health impact on neonates born at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. | PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt; This withdrawal syndrome is relatively mild and only requires medical intervention in approximately 4% of cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17990840&quot;/&gt;

===Public health issues===
Short-term exposure to high concentrations of chemical vapors that may exist in methamphetamine laboratories can cause severe health problems or even result in death. Exposure to these substances can occur from volatile air emissions, spills, fires, and explosions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5414a3.htm Acute Public Health Consequences of Methamphetamine Laboratories | Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC)]&lt;/ref&gt; Methamphetamine labs are often discovered when fire fighters respond to a blaze. Methamphetamine cooks, their families, and first responders are at highest risk of acute health effects from chemical exposure, including lung damage and chemical burns to the body. Following a seizure of a methamphetamine lab, there is often a low exposure risk to chemical residues, however this contamination should be sanitized. Chemical residues and lab wastes that are left behind at a former methamphetamine lab can result in health problems for people who use the property, therefore local health departments should thoroughly assess the property for hazards prior to allowing it to be re-inhabited, especially by children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HAC/pha/clandestine120704HC-WI/clandestine120704HC-WI.pdf Health Consultation | Agency for Toxic Substances &amp; Disease Registry (ATSDR)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Routes of administration==
Studies have shown that the subjective pleasure of drug use (the reinforcing component of addiction) is proportional to the rate at which the blood level of the drug increases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/301/2/690.full.pdf Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (JPET) | Onset of Action and Drug Reinforcement]&lt;/ref&gt; Intravenous injection is the fastest route of drug administration, causing blood concentrations to rise the most quickly, followed by smoking, [[suppository]] (anal or vaginal insertion), [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] (snorting), and [[ingestion]] (swallowing). Ingestion does not produce a [[Rush (psychology)|rush]], an [[Wiktionary:acute|acute]] [[Wiktionary:transcendent|transcendent]] state of [[euphoria]], as forerunner to the high experienced with the use of methamphetamine, which is most pronounced with intravenous use. While the onset of the rush induced by injection can occur in as little as a few seconds, the oral route of administration requires approximately half an hour before the high sets in. Thus, with both higher the dosage of methamphetamine used and faster the route of administration used, the higher potential risk for psychological addiction.

===Injection===
[[Drug injection|Injection]], also known as &quot;slamming&quot;, &quot;banging&quot;, &quot;shooting up&quot; or &quot;mainlining&quot;, is a popular method used by addicts which carries relatively greater risks than other methods of administration. The hydrochloride salt of methamphetamine is soluble in water. Intravenous users may use any dose range, from less than 100 [[milligram]]s to over one [[gram]], using a [[hypodermic needle]], although it should be noted that typically street methamphetamine is &quot;cut&quot; with a water-soluble cutting material, which constitutes a significant portion of a given street methamphetamine dose. Intravenous users risk developing [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE), a blockage of the main artery of the lung or one of its branches, and commonly develop skin rashes (also known as &quot;speed bumps&quot;) or infections at the site of injection. As with the injection of any drug, if a group of users [[needle sharing|share a common needle]] without sterilization procedures, blood-borne diseases, such as [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis]], can be transmitted.

===Smoking===
Smoking amphetamines refers to vaporizing it to inhale the resulting fumes, not burning it to inhale the resulting smoke. It is commonly smoked in glass pipes made from [[glassblowing|glassblown]] [[Pyrex|Pyrex tubes]] and light bulbs. It can also be smoked off aluminium foil, which is heated underneath by a flame. This method is also known as &quot;chasing the ''white'' dragon &quot; (whereas smoking [[heroin]] is known as &quot;[[chasing the dragon]]&quot;). There is little evidence that methamphetamine inhalation results in greater toxicity than any other route of administration. Lung damage has been reported with long-term use, but manifests in forms independent of route (pulmonary hypertension and associated complications), or limited to injection users (pulmonary emboli).

===Insufflation===
Another popular route to intake methamphetamine is insufflation (snorting), where a user crushes the methamphetamine into a fine powder and then sharply inhales it (sometimes with a straw or a rolled up [[banknote]], as with [[cocaine]]) into the nose where methamphetamine is absorbed through the soft tissue in the [[mucous membrane]] of the [[sinus cavity]] and straight into the bloodstream. This method of administration redirects [[first pass metabolism]], with a quicker onset and higher [[bioavailability]] than oral administration, though the duration of action is shortened. This method is sometimes preferred by users who do not want to prepare and administer methamphetamine for injection or smoking, but still experience a fast onset with a rush.

===Suppository===
Little research has been focused on the [[suppository]] (anal or vaginal insertion) method of administration. This method of administration is commonly administered using an [[oral syringe]]. Methamphetamine can be dissolved in water and withdrawn into an oral syringe which may then be lubricated and inserted into the anus or vagina before the plunger is pushed. Anecdotal evidence of its effects are infrequently discussed, possibly due to social taboos in many cultures. The rectum and the vaginal canal is where the majority of the drug would likely be taken up, through the membranes lining its walls. This method is often known within methamphetamine communities as a &quot;butt rocket&quot;, a &quot;booty bump&quot;, &quot;potato thumping&quot;, &quot;turkey basting&quot;, &quot;plugging&quot;, &quot;keistering&quot;, &quot;shafting&quot;, &quot;bumming&quot; and &quot;shelving&quot; (vaginal). It is anecdotally reported to increase sexual pleasure, while the effects of the drug last longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citypages.com/databank/24/1171/article11254.asp Meth Myths, Meth Realities]{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As methamphetamine is [[central nervous system|centrally active]] in the brain, these effects are likely experienced through the higher bioavailability of the drug in the bloodstream (second to injection) and the faster onset of action (than insufflation).

==Illicit production==
[[Image:Méthamphétamine pure.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Crystal]] methamphetamine]]
===Synthesis===
Synthesis is relatively simple, but entails risk with flammable and corrosive chemicals, particularly the solvents used in extraction and purification, therefore illicit production is often discovered by fires and explosions caused by the improper handling of volatile or flammable solvents. Most of the necessary chemicals are readily available in household products or [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] cold or allergy medicines. When illicitly produced, methamphetamine is commonly made by the [[Redox|reduction]] of [[ephedrine]] or [[pseudoephedrine]]. The maximum conversion rate for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine is 92%, though typically, illicit methamphetamine laboratories convert at a rate of 50% to 75%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.ucsc.edu/~cdobkin/Papers/Methamphetamine.pdf The War on Drugs: Methamphetamine, Public Health, and Crime | University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most methods of illicit production involve [[protonation]] of the [[hydroxyl]] group on the [[ephedrine]] or [[pseudoephedrine]] molecule. Methamphetamine is most structurally similar to [[methcathinone]] and [[amphetamine]]. The most common method for small-scale methamphetamine labs in the United States is primarily called the &quot;Red, White, and Blue Process&quot;, which involves red [[phosphorus]], [[pseudoephedrine]] or [[ephedrine]] (white), and blue [[iodine]] (which is technically a purple color in elemental form), from which [[Hydrogen iodide|hydroiodic acid]] is formed. In Australia, criminal groups have been known to substitute &quot;red&quot; phosphorus with either hypophosphorous acid or phosphorous acid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pacia.org.au/_uploaditems/docs/2.code_illicitdrugmanufsept05.pdf PACIA.org.au]{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a fairly dangerous process for amateur chemists, because [[phosphine]] gas, a side-product from [[in situ#Chemistry and chemical engineering|in situ]] hydroiodic acid production, is extremely toxic to inhale.

Another common method uses the [[Birch reduction]] (also called the &quot;Nagai method&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/methnet/understandingmeth/basics.html Illinois Attorney General | Basic Understanding Of Meth]&lt;/ref&gt; in which metallic [[lithium]], commonly extracted from non-rechargeable [[Lithium battery|lithium batteries]], is substituted for difficult-to-find metallic [[sodium]]. However, the Birch reduction is dangerous because the alkali metal and liquid [[anhydrous ammonia]] are both extremely reactive, and the temperature of liquid ammonia makes it susceptible to explosive boiling when reactants are added.

[[File:Meth ammonia tank Otley iowa.JPG|right|thumb||250px|Anti-meth sign on tank of [[anhydrous ammonia]], [[Otley, Iowa]]. Anhydrous ammonia is a common farm fertilizer which is also a critical ingredient in making methamphetamine. In 2005, Iowa state used grant money to give out thousands of locks to prevent criminals from getting into the tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thegazette.com/2009/10/06/anhydrous-ammonia-tank-locks-have-flaws |title=Anhydrous ammonia tank locks have flaws|author=The Gazette Staff|publisher=Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=6 Oct 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A completely different procedure of synthesis uses the [[reductive amination]] of [[phenylacetone]] with [[methylamine]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/amph.alhg.html A Synthesis of Amphetamine. J. Chem. Educ. 51, 671 (1974)]&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are currently [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] [[DEA list I chemicals|list I]] chemicals (as are pseudoephedrine and ephedrine). The reaction requires a catalyst that acts as a reducing agent, such as [[mercury-aluminum amalgam]] or platinum dioxide, also known as [[Adams' catalyst]]. This was once the preferred method of production by [[motorcycle gangs]] in [[California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8lWBixJv0QAC |title=No Speed Limit: The Highs and Lows of Meth |first=Frank |last=Owen |publisher=Macmillan |year=2007 |isbn=9780312356163 |chapter=Chapter 1: The Rise of Nazi Dope |pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; until DEA restrictions on the chemicals made the process difficult. Other less common methods use other means of hydrogenation, such as [[hydrogen]] [[gas]] in the presence of a [[catalyst]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Methamphetamine labs can give off noxious fumes, such as [[phosphine]] gas, [[methylamine]] gas, solvent vapors, [[acetone]] or [[chloroform]], [[iodine]] vapors, white [[phosphorus]], anhydrous [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen chloride]]/[[muriatic acid]], [[hydrogen iodide]], [[lithium]]/[[sodium]] metal, [[ether]], or methamphetamine vapors. If performed by amateurs, manufacturing methamphetamine can be extremely dangerous. If the red [[phosphorus]] overheats, because of a lack of ventilation, phosphine gas can be produced. This gas is highly toxic and, if present in large quantities, is likely to explode upon autoignition from [[diphosphine]], which is formed by overheating [[phosphorus]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In recent years, reports of a simplified &quot;Shake 'n Bake&quot; synthesis have surfaced. The method is suitable for such small batches that pseudoephedrine restrictions are less effective, it uses chemicals that are easier to obtain (though no less dangerous than traditional methods), and it is so easy to carry out that some addicts have made the drug while driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/health/2009/08/25/2009-08-25_new_method_for_making_crystal_meth_gets_around_drug_laws.html |title=New 'shake-and-bake' method for making crystal meth gets around drug laws but is no less dangerous |author=Associated Press |publisher=New York Daily News |date=August 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producing methamphetamine in this fashion can be extremely dangerous and has been linked to several fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alcoholism.about.com/od/meth/a/shake_and_bake.htm |title=Shake and Bake Meth | New 'Shake and Bake' Meth Method Explodes |accessdate=2009-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production and distribution===
[[Image:methjakarta.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Industrial-scale methamphetamine factory in Cikande, [[Indonesia]].]]
Until the early 1990s, methamphetamine for the U.S. market was made mostly in labs run by drug traffickers in [[Mexico]] and [[California]]. Since then, authorities{{Which?|date=July 2009}} have discovered increasing numbers of small-scale methamphetamine labs all over the United States, mostly in rural, suburban, or low-income areas.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} [[Indiana]] [[state police]] found 1,260 labs in 2003, compared to just 6 in 1995, although this may be partly a result of increased police activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070926225227/http://www.in.gov/cji/methfreeindiana/enforce.html Law Enforcement Facts, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, drug and lab seizure data suggests that approximately 80 percent of the methamphetamine used in the United States originates from larger laboratories operated by Mexican-based syndicates on both sides of the border and that approximately 20 percent comes from small toxic labs (STLs) in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Mobile and motel-based methamphetamine labs have caught the attention of both the U.S. news media and the police. Such labs can cause explosions and fires and expose the public to hazardous chemicals. Those who manufacture methamphetamine are often harmed by toxic gases. Many police departments have specialized task forces with training to respond to cases of methamphetamine production. The National Drug Threat Assessment 2006, produced by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], found &quot;decreased domestic methamphetamine production in both small and large-scale laboratories&quot;, but also that &quot;decreases in domestic methamphetamine production have been offset by increased production in Mexico.&quot; They concluded that &quot;methamphetamine availability is not likely to decline in the near term.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/ndic/pubs11/18862/meth.htm |title=Methamphetamine | National Drug Threat Assessment 2006 |accessdate=2009-08-25 |date = January 2006|publisher=National Drug Intelligence Center }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, Mexican officials at the port of [[Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán|Lázaro Cárdenas]] seized a ship carrying 19 tons of [[pseudoephedrine]], a raw material needed for methamphetamine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetelegram.com/index.cfm?pid=1154&amp;cpcat=world&amp;stry=59519030 Mexico says pseudoephedrine case signals breakdown in port security in U.S., China] AP, The Telegram (The Canadian Press), July 26, 2007. Olga R. Rodriguez&lt;/ref&gt; The shipment originated in [[Hong Kong]] and passed through the United States at the port of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] prior to its arrival in Mexico.

Methamphetamine is distributed by prison gangs, [[Outlaw motorcycle club|outlaw motorcycle gangs]], street gangs, traditional [[organized crime]] operations, and impromptu small networks.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In the United States, illicit methamphetamine comes in a variety of forms with prices varying widely over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/price_purity/ The Price and Purity of Illicit Drugs: 1981 Through the Second Quarter of 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, it is found as a colorless [[Wiktionary:crystalline|crystalline]] solid. Impurities may result in a brownish or tan color. Colorful flavored pills containing methamphetamine and [[caffeine]] are known as [[yaba (drug)|yaa baa]] (Thai for &quot;crazy medicine&quot;).

An impure form of methamphetamine is sold as a crumbly brown or off-white rock, commonly referred to as &quot;peanut butter crank&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

Another popular method is to combine methamphetamine with other [[stimulant|stimulant substances]], such as [[caffeine]] or [[cathine]], into a pill known as a &quot;Kamikaze&quot;, which can be particularly dangerous due to the [[synergistic|synergistic effects]] of multiple stimulants. It may also be flavored with high-sugar candies, drinks, or drink mixes to mask the bitter taste of the drug. Coloring may be added to the meth, as is the case with &quot;Strawberry Quick&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/02/health/main2752266.shtml Candy Flavored Meth Targets New Users] CBS News, May 2, 2007.

==Natural occurrence==
Methamphetamine has been reported to occur naturally in ''[[Acacia berlandieri]]'', and possibly ''[[Acacia rigidula]]'', trees that grow in [[West Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;BA Clement, CM Goff, TDA Forbes, Phytochemistry Vol.49, No 5, pp 1377–1380 (1998) &quot;Toxic amines and alkaloids from Acacia rigidula&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Methamphetamine and regular amphetamine were long thought to be strictly human-synthesized,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/shulgin/adsarchive/acacia.htm Ask Dr. Shulgin Online: Acacias and Natural Amphetamine]&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Acacia'' trees contain these and numerous other psychoactive compounds (e.g., [[mescaline]], [[nicotine]], [[dimethyltryptamine]]), and the related compound [[Phenethylamine|β-phenethylamine]] is known to occur from numerous ''Acacia'' species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Siegler, D.S.|title=Phytochemistry of ''Acacia—sensu lato'' |journal= Biochemical Systematics and Ecology |volume=31 |issue=8 |pages=845–873 |year=2003 |month=August |doi=10.1016/S0305-1978(03)00082-6 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings, however, have never been confirmed or repeated, leading some researchers to believe the results were the result of cross-contamination.

==Terminology==
[[Slang|Nicknames]] for methamphetamine are numerous and vary significantly from region to region. Some common nicknames for methamphetamine include &quot;ice&quot;, &quot;meth&quot;, &quot;crystal&quot;, &quot;crystal meth&quot;, &quot;crank&quot;, &quot;glass&quot;, &quot;chalk&quot;, &quot;fire&quot;, &quot;go-fast&quot;, &quot;tweak&quot;, &quot;nazi dope&quot;, &quot;jack&quot; and &quot;jib&quot; ([[United States and Canada]]), &quot;shabu&quot; ([[Japan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]]), &quot;tik&quot; ([[South Africa]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;UCT&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|work=UCT|accessdate=2009-08-13 |last=Plüddemann|first=Andreas| date=2005-06|title=Tik, memory loss and stroke|journal=Science in Africa|publisher=Science magazine for Africa CC|location=South Africa|url=http://www.scienceinafrica.co.za/2005/june/tik.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Sissonville Slim Fast&quot; ([[West Virginia]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-13890695.html Encyclopedia.com | Meth awareness meeting planned for Sissonville: Community to get information to fight drug problem.]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[ya ba]]&quot; ([[Thailand]]), and &quot;P&quot; ([[New Zealand]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police.govt.nz/safety/meth.html New Zealand Police | What is methamphetamine?]&lt;/ref&gt; The nickname most commonly used in the [[gay community]] is &quot;Tina&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/cs/healthfitness/a/crystal.htm About.com: Gay Life | Crystal Methamphetamine]&lt;/ref&gt; Methamphetamine may also be referred to as &quot;speed&quot;, a term that is commonly used for regular [[amphetamine]] without the [[methyl group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrodrug.org/drugs/methamphetamine.aspx Metropolitan Drug Commission | Methamphetamine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
{{Main|Legal status of methamphetamine}}
The production, distribution, sale, and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or illegal in many [[jurisdiction]]s. Methamphetamine has been placed in schedule II of the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |title=List of psychotropic substances under international control |accessdate=2010-05-10 |format=PDF |publisher=International Narcotics Control Board }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Please add only information that contributes to the general, global overview of legality. Details like country-specific laws may be appropriate, but the main article is probably the best place for that. --&gt;
